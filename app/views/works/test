I'm a quick learner who is dedicated to mastering new concepts and technologies in order to design and build practical software.  I enjoy investigating and solving problems, in code or otherwise. I'm looking for a challenging work environment where I can gain development experience, learn from others, and provide consistent contributions to projects.
